**TL;DR:** Use [scalaz.EphemeralStream](http://scalaz-seven-doc.cleverapps.io/core/target/scala-2.10/api/index.html#scalaz.EphemeralStream),
or roll out your own non-memoizing alternative to standard Scala streams.

[Lazy evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation),
also known as call-by-need, is commonly found in functional languages.
Some of them go as far as to make it the default evaluation strategy;
perhaps the most prominent example is Haskell.
Language authors however seem to prefer eager (strict) evaluation, 
whether because it results in better performance *in the majority of 
practical use cases*, or because it plays better with the imperative 
features of their languages, such as I/O and exceptions, 
or because the authors find it easier to implement.
So they add a number of features to the language and the standard library
that enable the developers to use lazy evaluation if they really want to.

In Scala, the language features are the `lazy` modifiers for `val`s
and by-name function parameters. And in the standard library,
amongs others, there is the class `Stream` (`scala.collection.immutable.Stream`),
which is the subject of this series.

Lazy evaluation often goes hand-in-hand with 
[memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization).
Without memoization, many programs implemented using lazy evaluation
would exhibit terrible performance characteristics. `Stream`
implements memoization and hence can be reasoned about as a `List`
of elements computed on-demand.

However, there are also scenarios in which memoization is highly undesirable.
One benefit of lazy evaluation is the ability to define potentially
infinite data structures. In case of streams, these can be a stream 
of natural numbers or a stream of data packets coming in from the network.
Problem is, all computers commercially available today
only support a finite amount of memory, so memoization of such
data structures is very capable of making your program throw an
`OutOfMemoryError`.

When you either have no need to use stream elements more then once,
as in the network packet filtering scenario, or stream elements
can be re-computed very cheaply (natural numbers), you better ensure
that they do *not* get memoized.

Below are the rules that will help you avoid memoization of Scala streams.
I've compiled them from various sources and confirmed
by compiliing and decompiling test programs.
If you know of any other techniques or edge cases, please post 
in the comments.

## Avoiding Stream memoization ##

1.  **Define streams using `def` and never store them in `val`s.**
    This should be obvious, because `val` *ensures* that memoizaion occurs -
    see `Stream` scaladoc - but obvious things
    are often worth stating explicitly.

2.  **Pass streams around via by-name parameters, consume them in tail-recursive functions.**
    This ensures that references to the original stream 
    do not remain on the call stack, effectively holding the entire 
    stream.

    In the below example, although the inner function `loop` is tail-recursive, 
    the `sum` function that calls it will hold a reference to the head of 
    the stream in its parameter:

          def sum(xs: Stream[Int]): Int = {
            @tailrec
            def loop(acc: Int, xs: Stream[Int]): Int =
              if (xs.isEmpty) acc else loop(acc+xs.head, xs.tail)
            loop(0, xs)
          }

    but if you make `xs` a by-name parameter to `sum`, it will hold a *function*
    that only gets computed right before the call to `loop`:

          def sum(xs: => Stream[Int]): Int = {
             .  .  .

    and its result does not hold the entire stream.

    You can also get rid of the outer function altogether using a default 
    parameter value:

          @tailrec
          def sum(xs: Stream[Int], z: Int = 0): Int = 
            if (xs.isEmpty) z else sum(xs.tail, z + xs.head)



3.  **Corollary: When defining stream-consuming functions in traits,
    wrap them in methods accepting streams as by-name parameters.**

    This one is subtle, and I would say the most unfortunate,
    because you have no control over the root cause of this restriction.
    The root cause is that trait methods are not called directly, but via 
    a forwarder method generated by the compiler, even if the caller
    is a member of the same trait.
    The forwarder method will hold a reference to the entire stream,
    that is, unless passed as a by-name parameter.

    Example:

          trait StreamConsumers {
            @tailrec
            final def sum(xs: Stream[Int], z: Int = 0): Int = {
              if (xs.isEmpty) z else sum(xs.tail, z + xs.head)
            }
            def sumByName(xs: => Stream[Int]): Int = {
              @tailrec def loop(acc: Int, xs: Stream[Int]): Int =
                if (xs.isEmpty) acc else loop(acc+xs.head, xs.tail)
              loop(0, xs)
            }

             .  .  .

          object Main extends StreamConsumers {
             .  .  .

    And here are the forwarders in the decompiled code of `Main`:

          public final class Main$
            implements StreamConsumers
          {
            public static final  MODULE$;
            
            public final int sum(Stream<Object> xs, int z) {
              return StreamConsumers.class.sum(this, xs, z);
            }
            public int sumByName(Function0<Stream<Object>> xs) {
              return StreamConsumers.class.sumByName(this, xs);
            }
             .  .  .

    <small>You may also notice that enclosing a tail-recursive function
    in a wrapper method relieves you from the need to 
    declare that method as final.</small>

4.  **Do not pattern match against streams outside the consuming functions.**

    It is perfectly okay to use pattern matching *inside* a 
    tail-recursive function that consumes the stream:

          def sumPatMatInner(xs: => Stream[Int]): Int = {
            @tailrec
            def loop(acc: Int, xs: Stream[Int]): Int =
              xs match {
                case Stream.Empty => acc
                case y #:: ys => loop(acc + y, ys)
              }
            loop(0, xs)
          }

    Hence a pattern matching addict might write something like this:

          def sumPatMat(xs: => Stream[Int]): Int = {
            @tailrec
            def loop(acc: Int, xs: Stream[Int]): Int =
              xs match {
                case Stream.Empty => acc
                case y #:: ys => loop(acc + y, ys)
              }
            xs match {
              case Stream.Empty => 0
              case x #:: Stream.Empty => x
              case y #:: ys => loop(y, ys)
            }
          }

    Why can this lead to an OOM? Let's consider a simpler example:
    
          createStream match {
            case x #:: xs => consumeStream(x, xs)
            case _ => println("No data to process")
          }
       
    As of Scala 2.10, this code is exactly equivalent to the following:

          val foo: Option[(A, Stream[A])] = Stream.#::.unapply(createStream)
          if (foo.isEmpty) println("No data to process")
          else {val x = foo.get._1; val xs = foo.get._2; consumeStream(x, xs)}
      
    where `A` is the type of stream elements and `foo` is a unique name not 
    used anywhere else. 

    As you may see, if the first pattern matches, `val xs` will hold a reference 
    to the tail of the stream returned by `createStream`.
    In fact, the temporary `val foo` will contain a reference to the entire stream.

    <small>StackOverflow user Daniel Martin described a solution
    for [safely matching on stream tail](http://stackoverflow.com/a/13218321),
    which I think is a nice demostration of Scala implicits,
    but otherwise an overkill, so I won't reproduce it here.</small>

5.  **Only call the eagerly evaluated `Stream` methods that are marked as *"optimized for GC"*.**
    The methods `foreach`, `foldLeft`, and `reduceLeft` have been specialized 
    for the class `Stream`. `length` is also "GC-safe". (Of course, they all
    loop forever if the receiver is an infinite stream.)

    However, the method `/:` was left with the default implementation from 
    `scala.collections.TraversableOnce`, which simply calls `foldLeft`, 
    effectively holding the reference to the receiver on its stack frame.

          def /:[B](z: B)(op: (B, A) => B): B = foldLeft(z)(op)

    This also applies to methods `forall`, `exists`, `find`, `max`, `min`,
    `sum`, `product`, and possibly others.


Now I have some news for you. Rules 2 to 5 are not entirely true.
